   - Use the "Check Now" button to refresh manually
   - Results are cached for 5 minutes to reduce API usage

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Invalid token" error:**
- Verify your token at [GitHub Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
- Ensure the token has `repo` or `public_repo` scope
- Try regenerating your token if it's old

**"Rate limit exceeded":**
- Wait a few minutes - GitHub allows 5,000 requests per hour
- The app will automatically retry when the limit resets
- Consider reducing check frequency if you hit limits often

**"Network error":**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify you can access github.com in your browser
- Try again in a few minutes

**Commits not detected:**
- Ensure commits are pushed to GitHub (local commits don't count)
- Check that commits are authored with your GitHub email
- Verify your timezone settings are correct

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Try the "Check Now" button to refresh
2. Check the console logs (F12 in dev mode)
3. Reset settings and reconfigure if needed
4. Open an issue on GitHub with error details

## Privacy

- Your GitHub token is stored locally on your machine
- No data is sent to any servers except GitHub's API
- The app only checks if you've made commits today
